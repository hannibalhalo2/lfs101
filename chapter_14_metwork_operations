 *interfaces de red 
 Network interfaces are a connection channel between a device and a network. Physically, network interfaces can proceed through a 
 network interface card (NIC), or can be more abstractly implemented as software. You can have multiple network interfaces operating 
 at once. Specific interfaces can be brought up (activated) or brought down (de-activated) at any time.
 la informacion de las interfaces se puede encontrar en ifocnfig
 
 *IP UTILITY
 To view the IP address:
$ /sbin/ip addr show
To view the routing information:
$ /sbin/ip route show

*ping
ping is used to check whether or not a machine attached to the network can receive and send data; i.e. 
it confirms that the remote host is online and is responding.

 *route
 A network requires the connection of many nodes. Data moves from source to destination by passing through a series of routers and potentially across multiple networks. Servers maintain routing tables containing the addresses of each node in the network. 
 The IP routing protocols enable routers to build up a forwarding table that correlates final destinations with the next hop addresses
 
 
 *traceroute
 muestra la ruta de un paquete atravez de 2 maquinas usando este comando se puede isioal problemas de conectividad entre 2 puntos  
 
 *mas herramientas de red
ethtool 	         Queries network interfaces and can also set various parameters such as the speed
netstat 	         Displays all active connections and routing tables. Useful for monitoring performance and troubleshooting
nmap 	             Scans open ports on a network. Important for security analysis
tcpdump 	         Dumps network traffic for analysis
iptraf 	           Monitors network traffic in text mode
mtr 	             Combines functionality of ping and traceroute and gives a continuously updated display
dig 	             Tests DNS workings. A good replacement for host and nslookup

*browser no graficos 
Lynx                  Configurable text-based web browser; the earliest such browser and still in use
ELinks                Based on Lynx. It can display tables and frames
w3m                   Another text-based web browser with many features.

*wget
descarga archivosd de internet pero necesita el link exacto del archivo que lo puede sacar desde el browser :v  
wget url

*curl
descaraga datos de internet talew como el source code de una pagina 
curl url

*scp
copia  archivos a un equipo remoto
scp <localfile> <user@remotesystem>:/home/user/

            -The IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique logical network address that is assigned to a device on a network.
            -IPv4 uses 32-bits for addresses and IPv6 uses 128-bits for addresses.
            -Every IP address contains both a network and a host address field.
            -There are five classes of network addresses available: A, B, C, D & E.
            -DNS (Domain Name System) is used for converting Internet domain and host names to IP addresses.
            -The ifconfig program is used to display current active network interfaces.
            -The commands ip addr show and ip route show can be used to view IP address and routing information.
            -You can use ping to check if the remote host is alive and responding.
            -You can use the route utility program to manage IP routing.
            -You can monitor and debug network problems using networking tools.
            -Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium, and Epiphany are the main graphical browsers used in Linux.
            -Non-graphical or text browsers used in Linux are Lynx, Links, and w3m.
            -You can use wget to download webpages.
            -You can use curl to obtain information about URLs.
            -FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer files over a network.
            -ftp, sftp, ncftp, and yafc are command line FTP clients used in Linux.
            -You can use ssh to run commands on remote systems.
